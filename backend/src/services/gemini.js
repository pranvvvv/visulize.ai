TASK: Analyze this image and provide a comprehensive yet accessible explanation.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: ${difficulty}

ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:
1. **Overview**: What is this image showing? Identify the main subject.
2. **Key Components**: List the main visible parts/components (number them).
3. **How It Works**: Explain the basic function or purpose.
4. **Interesting Facts**: Share 1-2 interesting details about what's shown.
5. **Next Steps**: Suggest what the user might want to explore by clicking on specific parts.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be engaging and educational
- Match your language complexity to the difficulty level
- If you can identify specific components, mention their approximate positions (left, right, top, bottom, center)
- Encourage the user to tap/click on specific parts to learn more
- Keep the response focused and not too long (aim for 200-400 words)
